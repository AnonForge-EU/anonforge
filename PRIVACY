# Privacy Policy

AnonForge collects **no personal data**.

- All generated identities and settings are stored **locally** on your device.
- Encrypted with AES-256-GCM (SQLCipher + Android Keystore).
- No network requests by default.
- Optional alias APIs (SimpleLogin, etc.) use **your own API keys** — we never see them.
- No analytics, no tracking, no crash reporting.

Your privacy is our priority.
